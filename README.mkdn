# toml-mode v0.1.3 (beta)

Emacs syntax hilighting for [TOML][toml]. This is my first Emacs syntax hilighting plugin; as a result, it may be buggy.

## INSTALL

If you have [marmalade][marmalade] or [melpa][melpa] and emacs24 installed, simply type

    M-x package-install toml-mode

In your .emacs

    (require 'toml-mode)

If you don't have marmalade installed, add these to your .emacs

    (require 'package)
    (add-to-list 'package-archives 
        '("marmalade" . "https://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
    (package-initialize)

`M-x eval-buffer` to evaluate it, and then do `M-x package-refresh-contents` to load in the package listing.
